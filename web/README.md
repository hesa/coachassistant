# Web service for coachassistant

## Running

As with the server component, Docker and Fig needs to be installed.

First, you will need to build a Docker image of the server. (You will also need
to rebuild the server if it changes.)

    $ docker build -t coachassistant-server ../server

Run the necessary containers and the web server:

    $ fig up

For rebuilding the project, do the following (as with the server component):

    $ fig kill && fig rm --force && fig build && fig up

The server will now be running at https://localhost/. We're using a snakeoil
HTTPS certificate that you will likely have to add as an exception to your
browser's HTTPS settings.

## Development

Start the services according to the instructions in the previous section.

Install Node.js:

    $ sudo apt-get install --yes nodejs

Install the grunt-cli and jslint packages:

    $ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli jslint

Install the Node.js dependencies for the project.

    $ npm install

Install the Bower dependencies for the project.

    $ bower install

Initiate the "dev" Grunt target.

    $ grunt dev

Now, any changes to JavaScript, HTML or CSS files in the source directory will
trigger a "rebuild" of the source code.

Additionally, you can use <code>grunt deps</code> to fetch and rebuild the
Bower dependencies. You can also use <code>grunt live</code> to, in addition to
performing the tasks of the two previous tasks, run JSLint on the source code.
